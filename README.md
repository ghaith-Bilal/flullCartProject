the main point of this app that when the user starts browsing this app
without taking step of log In,in this case when user add products 
to the cart,the products will delete from the application after two minutes 
of adding the last item to the cart,so when he closes the application 
and opens again the products will be deleted Automaticlly 
but when the user log in the application and adds products to the cart. 
in the case the products will be in the same status that user puts it in 
the cart (adding Products-Removing Products)and the cart won't change as long as the user is logged in.
Note:the data of adding list and User Information is stored in the Mobile memory
by using a useful Package called Shared Preferences.
